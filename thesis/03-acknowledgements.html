				Writing a thesis on an international phenomenon such as Holocaust Revisionism without being able to travel to archives or libraries in the United States, continental Europe or Great Britain has been a very difficult task. It could not have been accomplished at all had it not been for the kind assistance of the many people in many countries who supplied material in response to my letters of request. After searching out addresses in overseas telephone books at the local public library I wrote more than two hundred such letters, and I am pleased to say that I received responses to all but about twenty. I obtained additional material by placing an advertisement, explaining the nature of my investigation and requesting source material, in an American Revisionist newsletter and in two Jewish newspapers, one in the United States and one in Great Britain. I have chosen, of course, not to side with one school of thought against the other, but to seek critical distance and get <q>both sides of the story</q>. Noting that many scholars involved in the Holocaust controversy wear their moral values on their sleeves, I have consciously attempted not to do so, and not to let my own values harden into biases. Thus, I have contacted and on many occasions received and used material from both anti-Revisionist <i>and</i> Revisionist organizations and individuals. I make no apologies for this and I am tiling to acknowledge on this page the assistance I received from members of both camps, even from those whose views or actions I personally find unpalatable.

				My first thanks go to my dear wife, Kathy, who not only served as an admirable coffee maker during the year I worked on this thesis, but who also constantly encouraged and assisted me. I would now like to express my gratitude go the following people (listed alphabetically), whose assistance was invaluable: Ola N. H. Bruhner of Stockholm, who supplied me with French and German newspaper clippings on <q>The Faurisson Affair</q>, <q>The Roques Affair</q> and <q>The Paschoud Affair</q>; The Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons of New Zealand. Its small scholarship allowed me to purchase books and other necessary resources. David Irving, who supplied me with some of the material I requested and answered most of my questions; Howard English, Managing Editor of the B'nai B'rith Covenant (Canada), who assisted me several times in obtaining Canadian newspaper articles on the Ernst Zundel and James Keegstra trials; Mariette MacDonald, who translated for me newspaper clippings and journal articles from French to English; my thesis supervisor, Dr. Vincent Orange, a kind and patient mentor whose enthusiasm and knowledge about the events of the past greatly inspired me; Tony Robson of Searchlight magazine (London), who talked openly with me about Searchlight's activities and supplied me with copies of almost all of Searchlight's articles on David living, their bitter enemy; my deal friends Margaret and (the late) Allen Stott, who defended my right to intellectual autonomy when immoderate and uninformed factions challenged it, and who assisted me in many other ways; Mark Weber of the <a href="http://www.ihr.org/">Institute for Historical Review</a>, who also talked openly with me on two or three occasions, providing important information. His frequent criticism (occasionally in the form of an admonishment) was very helpful. He also supplied a wealth of requested (and much unrequested) material, John W. Weir of Overland Park, Kansas, who very kindly allowed me to borrow for a lengthy period his substantial and valuable collection of Revisionist newsletters. I would also like to thank the following individuals and organizations, who provided me with the advice, information or source material I requested from them: Robert Erwin and the indefatigable staff of the Information Services of the University of Canterbury library, who almost always managed to track down the obscure German or Austrian sources I wanted; American Jewish Archives (Cincinnati); American Jewish Committee, William E.
