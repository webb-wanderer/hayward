			"&hellip; an important new contribution. &hellip;<i> [Stopped at Stalingrad]</i> not only provides an interesting way of looking at one of the most studied battles of the war but also makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the war on the eastern front.

			"This campaign history is a well-written study of great victories and incredible defeats. As Hayward relates these events, he shows his mastery of the subject, starting with incisive background information that explains Germany's desire for Soviet oil. As the battles unfold, he aptly describes events at many different areas of the front without confusing the reader. Hayward writes of weapons, strategies, and leaders in a clear and understandable way. History buffs, strategy lovers, and warriors learning about their profession will all enjoy Stopped at Stalingrad. It will also encourage Americans who are much more familiar with the combat history of their own forces to learn more about the Soviet experience in World War II."
