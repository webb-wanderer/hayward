		"Joel Hayward and his thesis, while being subjected to the full blast of [public] criticism some thought they deserved, should not have been subjected to what amounted to censure from the university. It had, after all, accepted Dr Hayward as a suitable candidate for a Master's degree, supervised his work, and accepted his examiners' assessment. To renege &mdash; to open the thesis to a second assessment &mdash; was to be seen as craven at worst and confused at best".

<p>
	I have spent the last decade or two living as an author, biographer, historian, senior academic, defence analyst, media pundit, and more (all usually at the same time). And I have, with God's grace, been quite successful in several of the things I have attempted. Certainly no-one has questioned my aptitude or the quality of my efforts and results. In fact I was, and am, respected in the artistic and professional circles mentioned above. Yet a small group of misguided souls did, a few years ago, launch a highly public attack on me within New Zealand. This website is my explanation of that wretched business.
</p>
<p>
	This small website isn't very biographical, I'm afraid. Despite some public recognition in New Zealand I am a very private man. But the site does contain several documents that I consider important to gaining a full understanding of the attempts made by those intolerant individuals and "thought police" to destroy my career and well-being.
</p>
<p>
	My goal in establishing this site this year (2003) was not to participate in any politically motivated debates, especially the long-running and, in my experience, distasteful, international Holocaust revisionism/anti-Holocaust revisionism debate.
</p>
<p>
	I have no interest in that or any other political debate. I am not a Holocaust denier. I do not like Holocaust denial. And I do not feel any need to tell people what is "true" and what is not, or what is "right" and what is not. People can make up their own minds, and I certainly don't mind if they disagree with any or all of the views I have ever expressed since my birth in 1964.
</p>
<p>
	Prompted by two <i>very</i> misleading <i>Listener</i> articles, my aim in assembling the documents on this website was only to give any interested New Zealanders searching for information a more complete and less polemical picture of one local free-speech "crisis" and its savage but now-finished fallout. That crisis was one of this small and insular nation's most needless, vitriolic and public academic controversies: "The Canterbury Affair."
</p>
<p>
	This site reflects my own "take" on events, and contains materials that I think will help to bring transparency to what has been a rather murky business. Readers wanting another perspective are encouraged to obtain from their libraries back issues of <i>The New Zealand Jewish Chronicle.</i> I can't find a website for the <i>Chronicle,</i> otherwise I'd post a link.
</p>
<p>
	Please wander through this material, and contact me if you have corrections, questions or something (polite) to say.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you.
</p>
<p>
	Dr Joel Hayward

	Dr Joel Hayward is a New Zealand scholar, writer and poet. Dr Joel Hayward is also a world recognised military historian. Although some people know Dr Joel Hayward&rsquo;s name because of a masters thesis on Holocaust revisionism that he wrote at Canterbury University in Christchurch over a decade ago Dr Joel Hayward is not a Holocaust revisionist and does not support Holocaust revisionism. Dr Joel Hayward lives in Palmerston North in New Zealand.
