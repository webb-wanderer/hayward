			I offer no comment on the points of the Petition, and advise readers to read it carefully and to contact Professor Martin Lally (contact details given below) if they wish to criticise it, comment on it, or sign it.

			PETITION: TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CANTERBURY
		</p>
		<p>
			In relation to the masters thesis of Joel Hayward at the University of Canterbury, we note the following events, of which the first five are detailed on the University&rsquo;s own website:
		</p>
		<p>
			1. Joel Hayward was awarded a Masters degree by thesis, with first class honours, by the University of Canterbury in 1993, in accordance with the procedures that the University employed at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. It was subsequently argued by an external party that the degree should be revoked.
		</p>
		<p>
			3. The University of Canterbury established a Working Party in 2000 to examine this claim.
		</p>
		<p>
			4. The Working Party concluded that the thesis was not dishonest, and therefore could not be "amended, removed, downgraded or altered". It further concluded that the thesis was flawed and did not deserve the award of first class honours.
		</p>
		<p>
			5. The University accepted these conclusions, apologised to those who were offended by the thesis, and stated that it did not support holocaust revisionism.
		</p>
		<p>
			6. Dr Hayward resigned from his position at Massey University in 2002, apparently as a result of the ongoing hostility towards him arising from the previous events.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recently, Dr Thomas Fudge of Canterbury's History Department wrote a review of these events, for inclusion in the University&rsquo;s journal 'History Now'. Although the journal was printed with this article, the Head of the University&rsquo;s History Department (Professor Peter Hempenstall) destroyed copies of the journal, with the concurrence of the University&rsquo;s Vice-Chancellor (Professor Roy Sharp). As a result of this action by the University, the editor (Associate Professor Ian Campbell) has now left that position, and Dr Fudge has indicated his intention to resign from the University.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our views on these events are follows. Notwithstanding any personal misgivings or objections that individual signatories may have as to the content of the thesis, we believe that certain fundamental principles have been breached by the University. First, we accept that a University has both the right and the obligation to revoke any thesis on the grounds of proven dishonesty. However, in the event of it not revoking a thesis on those grounds, we believe that it is totally inappropriate for any university administrator or sponsored body to issue negative public judgements about it, or to apologise to anyone who may be offended by it. No student should be subject to a de facto second round of assessment as to the quality (as opposed to the honesty) of their thesis, particularly after having just been exonerated of the charge of dishonesty.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, we believe that the Working Party's actions in criticising the quality of the thesis, and the University&rsquo;s public reiteration of that, constitutes the very 'downgrade' that the Working Party asserted to be unwarranted. We consider it inconceivable that the University and the Working Party did not understand the contradiction involved here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thirdly, we do not believe that it is the business of any university administrator to issue public pronouncements upon any historical issues that are unrelated to the University. This is a matter for individual academics in the relevant area, in the normal exercise of their professional duties.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, whilst there may be a range of opinions concerning the University&rsquo;s action in destroying copies of 'History Now', we view the destruction of any published academic work with considerable concern. These concerns are not ameliorated by the University&rsquo;s earlier and clear breaches of the fundamental rights of a thesis student, of its own judgement that the thesis could not be downgraded, and of the proper boundary between academics and administrators in the issuing of public statements.
		</p>
		<p>
			We further consider that the effect of the University&rsquo;s actions has been to send a clear signal to potential students and other researchers at the University as to the acceptable conclusions to be reached in a particular area of enquiry, and this is antithetical to the proper function of any university. Furthermore, the effect of the University&rsquo;s actions is likely to have contributed to the general climate of hostility towards Dr Hayward, and therefore to his subsequent resignation from Massey University.
		</p>
		<p>
			These University actions are improper, and place an obligation upon the University of Canterbury to acknowledge its errors and to offer appropriate remedies to Dr Hayward.
		</p>
		<p>
			As signatories, we understand that this petition may be placed as an advertisement in various newspapers.
