		<h2>
			German journal
		</h2>
		<p>
			In response to silly claims that I have knowingly published in a Neo-Nazi jounal:
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1999 a Dr Lennard Rose asked me by email if he could reprint in the German language journal that he edited a German translation of an article I had myself posted on the net. The article was pure military analysis; on Wehrmacht jointery in Russia during the Crimean campaign of 1942.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was a good piece; one I am still proud of. In 1999 it appeared in the Volume 22, No. 4 issue of the prestigious international scholarly periodical <i>The Journal of Strategic Studies</i>. This was, it should be noted, my second article to appear in this leading journal.
		</p>
		<p>
			I encourage anyone interested in these issues to read the English text in <i>The Journal of Strategic Studies</i>. He or she will see that it is certainly not laudatory of Hitler and his regime. It is a warfighting analysis, dealing with issues of service integration between army, air force and navy.
		</p>
		<p>
			I did not know Dr Rose by name or reputation, and I did not at the time that the <i>Vierteljahreshefte fuer Zeitgeschichte</i> was anything but an ordinary journal.
		</p>
		<p>
			I gave permission, keen to build up the list of my publications in peer-reviewed journals. A German translation of my <i>Journal of Strategic Studies</i> article seemed fine to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			It turned out that Dr Lennard Rose was one of <a href="http://www.holocaust-history.org/denial/nym.shtml">many pseudonyms</a> used by Mr Germar Rudolf, a German extremist who published right-wing and sometimes antisemitic works. I was once told by Mr Harry Mazal of the reputable <a href="http://www.holocaust-history.org/denial/nym.shtml">Holocaust-History.org</a> foundation that Germar Rudolf had used a similar technique to secure numerous other scholars' contributions to his various publishing efforts.
		</p>
		<p>
			He is at fault; not me.
